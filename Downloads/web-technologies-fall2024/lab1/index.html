    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Alex. I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree at Saint Louis University, and I’m in my third semester. 
        I am taking a course in Web Technologies, which focuses on understanding the structure, components, and technologies used to build and maintain websites, rather than programming itself. 
        This course is teaching me essential concepts like HTML, CSS, and how the web works, which are critical for creating modern and responsive websites. 
        While the course doesn't focus on programming, it provides a strong foundation in web technologies, which is essential for understanding how web applications function. 
        These skills are highly beneficial this semester because they help me understand the key principles behind web development, which I can later apply when learning programming languages like JavaScript for front-end or server-side development.
        This knowledge will also prepare me for future roles in full-stack web development, where a deep understanding of web architecture and technologies is crucial for designing, maintaining, and optimizing web applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h2>
    <img src="/Users/alexchilaka/Downloads/pwa-image.jpg" alt="Progressive Web App Benefits" width="400"><br>
    <p>While progressive web apps (PWAs) aren't new, their latest iteration will replace web apps for good.PWAs help websites load in no time and work offline in apps like Google Maps. Companies including Starbucks, Uber, Pinterest, and Twitter use PWAs for an improved user experience — and in 2024, many more organizations have already caught on.In the last quarter of 2023, over 58% of International web traffic was from mobile — not including tablets. With the increased usage of smartphones and tablets to perform various online tasks, it has never been more essential to revamp web applications into PWAs.

        In addition to providing unmatched user experience, PWAs offer additional benefits such as reduced website development costs and seamless maintenance for the provider. Plus, they visually look and act like a regular web page.
        
        In 2024, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, WebAssembly, or Angular will be used to write PWAs. Web developers are embracing PWA principles to provide dependable and engaging user experiences.
        
        Moreover, most contemporary frameworks already include basic PWA configurations or additional packages that convert an application into a PWA. These can make it easier to start a new PWA project and introduce new files into an already-existing project.
        
        My take: I love PWAs because of their quick load times. If I’m using a website and it takes forever to load, I’ll often find a different option. That’s especially true when I’m on the go, trying to cross tasks quickly when I’m on the go.</p>
